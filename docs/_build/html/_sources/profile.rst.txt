By default, there is no profile photo inserted on the top left corner. If you want to add it in your profile, click the Choose File button to browse the image on your computer.

No matter what small or large the pixels you upload in your profile, it will automatically resize the photo to static format.

You can also enable two factor authentication in your profile by using Google authenticator. In uAdmin, it uses QR code which is typically used for storing URLs or other information for reading by the camera on a smartphone.

If there is a problem, you may go to your terminal and check the OTP login.
